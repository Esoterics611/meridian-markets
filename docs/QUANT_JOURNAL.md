## 2026-06-01 — Entry #1: position sizing truth + first cross-asset value board

**Hypotheses going in:** (a) "bigger size → smaller fee" (desk intuition); (b)
stat-arb is unprofitable after fees ("fee drag dominates", prior diagnosis).

**Method:** `scripts/quant-research.ts` — pull real Binance klines, discover
cointegrated pairs per asset-class preset, backtest the strategy catalogue ×
entry-z × **bar interval**, net of 5 bps/leg (HistoricalReplayVenue). Two windows:
**1m × 1000 (~17h)** and **15m × 1000 (~10.4 days)**, the latter re-run at a
realistic **$25k/leg** (balanced 25% of a $100k book). Raw:
`docs/research/2026-05-31-22-{18,21,28}-quant-research.json`.

### Finding 1 — position size is a RISK lever, not an alpha lever (intuition #a is FALSE)
Under flat % fees, gross P&L and fees both scale linearly with notional, so
**net edge in bps and Sharpe are size-invariant.** Proven empirically (sizing
study, GRT/NEAR): $25k → +$3,916 · $250k → +$39,162 · $2.5M → +$391,616 — exactly
×10/×100, while **edge/trade = 313 bps and Sharpe = 1.00 stay flat.** Fees are a
*percentage of notional* — a bigger trade pays a proportionally bigger fee. "Big
size, tiny fee" only holds if there's a **fixed** commission; we have none.

What *does* cap size is **market impact** (∝ N²). For GRT/NEAR (15m ADV ≈ $22.7k/
bar), the impact-optimal per-leg notional is **N\* ≈ $89k** (net after impact ≈
$6,960); beyond it, impact eats more than half the marginal edge. So a $100k book
is roughly the right scale *for this liquid pair* — thinner legs cap far lower
(at 1m, ARB/OP's N\* was ~$133). **Surfaced in the UI:** Research → ⚖ Position
sizing & fee economics, and `POST /api/market-data/sizing-study`.

### Finding 2 — bar interval is the biggest free profitability lever (intuition #b is conditionally FALSE)
Same strategy, same pairs, only the bar changes:
- **1m (~17h):** best config +$11.6 (eth pairs-ewma), edge/trade ~19 bps; most
  classes 0 trades (fee gate stands aside) or net-negative; OU bled (−$143…−$213).
- **15m (~10d):** the board flips positive. Slower bars grow σ-per-trade while the
  ~20 bps round-trip fee is fixed, so **edge/trade clears the floor with margin**
  (65–79 bps on the good classes). The prior "fee drag dominates" diagnosis was a
  **1m artifact** — it does not generalise to 15m.

### Finding 3 — where the value is (15m, $25k/leg, net of fees, ~10 days)
| Class | Strategy | eZ | trades | net $ | edge/trade | Sharpe | win% | pairs +ve |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **eth-ecosystem** | pairs-zscore | 2.5 | 16 | **+2,614** | 65 bps | **3.16** | 83% | **4/4** |
| eth-ecosystem | pairs-zscore | 2.0 | 23 | +2,537 | 44 bps | 1.71 | 88% | 4/4 |
| eth-ecosystem | ou-bertram | · | 23 | +1,563 | 27 bps | 1.62 | 79% | 4/4 |
| ai-data | pairs-zscore(-wide) | 2.0 | 23 | +4,549 | 79 bps | 0.37 | 70% | 3/4 |
| gaming-meta | pairs-zscore | 2.5 | 20 | +1,551 | 31 bps | 0.33 | 65% | 4/4 |
| l1-smart-contract | pairs-zscore-wide | 2.5 | 18 | +1,573 | 35 bps | 0.65 | 76% | 3/4 |
| **crypto-majors** | (everything) | — | — | ≈0 / negative | <3 bps | ~0 | ~50% | — |

- **Consistency winner = eth-ecosystem z-score @ eZ 2.5** (ARB/STRK, IMX/STRK,
  ARB/OP, ARB/IMX): Sharpe 3.16, **every pair positive**, 83% win. This is the
  "nice consistent profits over days" candidate.
- **ai-data** makes the most dollars but is lumpier (Sharpe 0.37) — fewer, fatter,
  higher-variance reversions.
- **crypto-majors does NOT pair-trade profitably** after fees at any interval/
  entry tested — the legs are too co-integrated-but-tight (low σ-spread). Stop
  hunting there.

### Finding 4 — the new strategies (shipped this session) validated
- `pairs-zscore-selective` / `pairs-zscore-wide` (wider band + stiffer fee gate):
  match baseline on clean classes (the gate doesn't bind at eZ2.5), and **add real
  value on noisy classes** — e.g. gaming-meta @ eZ1.5: selective **+$1,294 vs
  baseline +$608** (the 2× fee gate skipped the sub-fee entries). Confirmed: the
  fee gate is alpha on noisy universes.
- `ou-bertram-throttled` (price the *true* 20 bps, not 8 bps): **mixed** — cut the
  bleed on crypto-majors (−816 → −186) and payments, but **hurt** l1 and ai (it
  also skips good trades). Verdict: pricing cost higher is not a uniform fix; OU
  needs a **time-stop** instead (queued). Kept in the catalogue, not a default.

**Decisions:**
- SHIP (catalogue): `pairs-zscore-selective`, `pairs-zscore-wide`,
  `pairs-ewma-conviction`, `ou-bertram-throttled` — all live-capable, deployable
  from the UI/scan.
- DEPLOY CANDIDATE for a consistent book: **eth-ecosystem z-score @ eZ 2.5**, and a
  diversified basket of the 4/4-positive configs above, vol-targeted. **Blocked
  on OOS validation** before treating the Sharpe as real.
- KILL: crypto-majors pair-trading; `ou-bertram-fast` (overtrades, deep losses at
  both intervals); EWMA at eZ1.5 on most classes (net-negative).

**Next actions (top of the backlog):**
1. **OOS / walk-forward on real history** for the eth-ecosystem eZ2.5 basket —
   plumb `ReplayEngine` into `/api/stat-arb/research/*` (today it's synthetic) +
   add a train/test split to the harness. *Gate before any "it's profitable" claim.*
2. **Risk-parity allocator**: auto-launch the fee-clearing pairs sized ∝ 1/σ_spread
   for a smooth daily curve (breadth > size).
3. **Maker execution** for stat-arb entries (reuse MM infra) — would cut the ~20 bps
   floor toward zero and re-open crypto-majors + 1m.
4. **Time-stopped OU** (`maxHoldBars`) — the right fix for OU overtrading.
5. **Data hygiene**: `defi-bluechip` + `stablecoin-peg` presets collapse to 0
   aligned bars (sparse/late-listed tickers); fix the harness/`alignMany` to drop
   the offenders, then re-scan those classes.
